      <h3>How To</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose your colors and cut the string
        </li>
        <li>Bunch your strings together and tie a knot at one end. You could also double the length of the strings and fold in half, tying in a loop knot instead.
        </li>
        <li>Tape the group of strings to a flat surface, or pin them to your pants, whatever works best for you. Line the strings in the order you want them and mirror them on the other side.
        </li>
        <li> Cross the first string on the left side over the second string and push the first string underneath the second and pull. In other words, create a left hand knot. It's very important that you cross the first string over the second when you knot, or else it won't work. Knot each string twice.
        </li>
        <li>The first sting and the second string should now have switched places. Continue the process of knotting until you have finished the first half and the first string is now in the center and the second string is on the outside.
        </li>
        <li>Now you do the same thing on the opposite side, only mirrored. Cross the first string over the second and finish knotting. This is a right hand knot. Continue until you reach the center.
        </li>
        <li>Now knot the 2 middle strings together. These should be the first strings from either side before. It doesn't matter which direction you knot them.
        </li>
        <li>Continue until you've reached your desired length.
        </li>
        <li>When you're finished, either tie it around your wrist or give it to a friend. And you're done!
        </li>
      </ol>
